      <p>I love  how nimble you are - I can just 'git init' any directory and it's a repository just like that. I love the way you keep track of files and meticulously show changes in a 'git diff'. </p>

  <div class="section c">
    <div class="parent">
      <p>I love the how mad you get when there's merge conflicts; how you make me go through and fix them all before committing anything. I love the how you just can't let go of anything I've done in the past, how a 'git log' will show me all the comits I've made.</p>

      <p>And I love the way you keep all your files hidden, but if I go looking for them, I can find them and see what's really going on with you. I love your simple interface, your essential utility, and your whole philosophy of coding.</p>
